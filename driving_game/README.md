I'll help you set up and run the game on macOS. First, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies and compile the code.

1. First, install the required tools using Homebrew. If you don't have Homebrew installed, install it by running:
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
brew install freeglut
```

3. Save the game code to a file named `driving_game.cpp`

4. Create a CMakeLists.txt file to manage the build:



```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(DrivingGame)

# Find required packages
find_package(OpenGL REQUIRED)
find_package(GLUT REQUIRED)

# Add executable
add_executable(driving_game driving_game.cpp)

# Link libraries
target_link_libraries(driving_game
    ${OPENGL_LIBRARIES}
    ${GLUT_LIBRARIES}
)

# Include directories
target_include_directories(driving_game PRIVATE
    ${OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    ${GLUT_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)

# Set C++ standard
set_target_properties(driving_game PROPERTIES
    CXX_STANDARD 17
    CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON
)

```

5. Create a build directory and compile the game:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

6. Run the game:
```bash
./driving_game
```

Game Controls:
- W: Move forward
- S: Move backward
- A: Turn left
- D: Turn right
- Space: Stop
- R: Reset game

If you encounter any issues with the compilation, make sure:
1. Your macOS developer tools are installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

2. OpenGL frameworks are properly linked (they should be by default on macOS)

Let me know if you run into any issues, and I'll help you troubleshoot them!
